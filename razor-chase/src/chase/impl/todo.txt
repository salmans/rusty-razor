- wrap expressions in views
- fix FIXMEs

improvements:
- maybe $$domain doesn't need to be of type <Tup>, rather <E>
- maybe remove body and head from sequent?
- copy the current model n-1 times where n is the number of branches
- use thiserror
- minimize equality axioms (no need for reflexive and symmetric)
- consider looking up a function before making it true in the model

tests:
- test evaluate
- test empty head
- test empty body
- test range_restrict with OR
- test theory extend
