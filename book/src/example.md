# Example

This section presents sample first-order theories, written in Razor's syntax.
All examples are inspired by the events of Game of Thrones (_spoiler alert!!_).

- [Valar Morghulis](./example/valar-morghulis.html): demonstrates a run of Razor on a simple example.
- [Golden Head](./example/golden-head.html): runs Razor over an unsatisfiable theory for which no models exist.
- [Hold the Door](./example/hold-the-door.html): covers more advanced features of Razor on theories with infinite models.

For more examples, see Razor's [example theories](https://github.com/salmans/rusty-razor/tree/master/theories/examples).
